__This is an "early alpha", more of a technical demo. More content will be added (like a purpose to play the game)__

Current features:

+ Random enemy placement
+ Sprite animation (static and 2 death animations)
+ Random "world" generation (wall placement)
+ Gun shot
+ Bullet collisions
+ Keyboard layout selection

TODO:

+ Remove unused assets.
+ Better stuff than a couple of alert() at loading
+ Prevent sprites from spawning inside the cubes
+ Fix starting position
+ Cooldown on guns
+ Death animations for monsters
+ AI / Pathfinding
+ A real HUD, at least centered (don't tell me this one is)
+ Add weapons?
+ DOOM's original shotgun behaviour (more than 1 pellet)
+ Fix buggy collisions [x]
+ Add other enemies
+ Make fix levels? Or improved random placement of "walls".
+ Console to enter cheats and stuff like that?

Thanks a lot Demonixis, if you ever come across this repo, your [micro fps tutorial](http://www.demonixis.net/blog/un-micro-fps-en-javascript-avec-babylonjs/)
has been very useful. (And I even borrowed some of your stuff like the getForwardVector() function).
